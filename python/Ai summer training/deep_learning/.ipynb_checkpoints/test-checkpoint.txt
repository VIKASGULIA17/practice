New Portfolio, New Vibes

Hey everyone! I'm excited to share that Iâ€™ve completely revamped my personal portfolio website ðŸŽ‰
After nearly a year with my previous one, I felt it was time for a fresh look that truly reflects my growth and evolving design sense.

 New Portfolio: vikasgulia.netlify.app
 Old Portfolio (for comparison): vikasguliaportfolio.netlify.app
Whatâ€™s new?

 Sleek animations & smooth effects
 Improved color palette & layout
 Sections include: Hero, About Me, and Featured Projects
 Overall, it's more dynamic and user-friendly!

Also, a quick academic update:
Iâ€™ve scored a 9.55 GPA this semester, bringing my overall GPA to 9.5! Grateful for the consistency and support. ðŸ™Œ

Would love to hear your feedback on the new portfolio!
Letâ€™s connect, collaborate, and grow!
